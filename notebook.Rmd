Get info on area codes


```{r}
 dta_uk %>% 
  mutate(first_three = str_extract(AreaCode, "^[A-Z][0-9]{2}")) %>% 
  group_by(RegionName, first_three) %>% 
  mutate(date = lubridate::dmy(Date)) %>% 
  summarise(
    n_observations = length(date),
    first_date = min(date),

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
